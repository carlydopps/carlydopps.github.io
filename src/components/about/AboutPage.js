                <div class="col text-muted">
                    <p>I was drawn to programming through a love of math, language, and creativity. Since then, I have become even more intrigued by the computational yet creative mindset programming ignites. I'm continuously drawn to it because it's often a blank slate that you have to jump into and start building and creating, or it's an intricate web where you have to find the loose thread that’s making the entire project unravel.</p>

                <h3 class="display-6 col col-md-2">When</h3>
                <p class="col text-muted">Around a year ago I left a job I loved because I found a passion for programming. I discovered programming while working with computer science graduate students. I started studying the fundamentals to better understand the students' curriculum, and it sparked an ambition to use concepts of programming to improve workflows across all engineering programs. I dove into building new tools to automate tasks, reduce error, and increase efficiency. It started as just a small curiosity but turned into a career leap, and I haven’t looked back since.</p>

                <h3 class="display-6 col col-md-2">Where</h3>
                <p class="col text-muted">I recently completed an immersive, full-time program at Nashville Software School where we focused on full stack fundamentals and remote team collaboration. We utilized JavaScript, React, Python, and Django and developed multiple web applications with CRUD functionality and RESTful APIs. We applied object-oriented programming daily through group and individual projects. The program then culminated in a web based project in a simulated company environment.</p>

                <h3 class="display-6 col col-md-2">How</h3>
                <p class="col text-muted">I’m an autonomous learner who seeks new projects and languages to expand my skills. I value the balance of humility to know when to ask for help along with autonomy to research errors and new concepts before doing so. I also value a deep understanding of the fundamentals and ensuring a strong foundation to build upon.</p>

                    <p> A few years ago, my husband and I decided to pursue a childhood dream of adventuring across the country. We spent two years traveling the country in a camper that we renovated together. Sometimes we were the only people we knew on a little road of an unknown town in a brand new state, and it taught me so much about enjoying the ups and downs of the adventure and the serendipity of chance encounters.</p>
                    <p>"When everything goes wrong, that's when the adventure begins." - Yvon Chouinard</p>
                    <p>Two years, twenty-nine states, four flat tires, and a lot of broken things later, it still feels like a dream.</p>
